  "product": "Cura Desktop — AI-Powered Desktop Agent with Embedded Coding Agent & Meeting Intelligence",
  "company": "CuraLabs (Meetngig, Inc.)",
  "website": "https://www.curalabs.io",
  "value_proposition": "Cura is a desktop-native AI agent that captures meetings in stealth mode, extracts action items, and then actually executes them — on the user's machine. It has an embedded coding agent that can operate the computer autonomously: running scripts, automating desktop workflows, interacting with local apps and files. Integrations are MCP-based (Model Context Protocol) — Asana, Gmail, Calendar, QuickBooks, and more come built-in, but any MCP server can be added on request, making Cura extensible to virtually any tool a customer uses. Supports auto-approval mode or fully autonomous operation. Your admin team spends 2+ hours/day on post-meeting follow-up — Cura automates 80% of that. At $200-500/mo per seat, it pays for itself in the first week.",
