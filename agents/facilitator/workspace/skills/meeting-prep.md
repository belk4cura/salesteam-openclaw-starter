# Skill: Meeting Prep — Give/Get Cheat Sheet

## Purpose
Before every prospect meeting, generate a one-page cheat sheet telling the human exactly what to give, what to get, and what to watch for.

## Cheat Sheet Format

### Header
```
MEETING PREP: [Company Name]
Date: [date] | Stage: [deal stage] | Weighted Value: $[amount]
Attendees: [list of expected attendees with roles]
```

### Section 1: Context (2-3 sentences)
Where we are in the deal. What happened last time. What the prospect expects from this meeting.

### Section 2: GIVE (What to share)
List 2-3 specific things to offer:
- "Share the admin productivity benchmark for [their industry]"
- "Walk through the Asana integration demo (but NOT full product demo yet)"
- "Offer a 2-week pilot for their EA team"

**Rules:**
- Only give what earns something back
- Don't demo the full product until you have budget confirmation
- Save the best candy for when you need access to a new stakeholder

### Section 3: GET (What to ask for)
List 2-3 specific things to extract:
- "Confirm budget range ($X-Y/mo per seat)"
- "Get timeline: when do they need this implemented?"
- "Ask to loop in IT Director for compatibility review"
- "Verify: who else needs to approve this?"

**Rules:**
- Always get something. Never leave a meeting having only given.
- If you can't get budget info, get timeline. If not timeline, get stakeholder access.
- The most important GET is always: "Who else needs to be involved?"

### Section 4: WATCH FOR (Signals)
**Buying Signals (Good):**
- Asks about pricing details or seat counts
- Asks about implementation timeline
- Mentions specific team members who would use it
- Asks about contract terms or pilot programs
- Shares internal challenges openly

**Slow No Signals (Bad):**
- "We need to think about it"
- "Management will review"
- "Send me more information" (without committing to a follow-up)
- "We're looking at several options"
- Cancels or reschedules multiple times
- Only one person shows up (single-threaded)

### Section 5: NEXT STEPS
What to propose at the end of the meeting:
- Specific follow-up date and time
- Who should be in the next meeting
- What deliverable you'll send afterward
