### Technical Buyer (Priority 3 — feasibility check)
The person who evaluates whether Cura works with their systems.

## Research Process
1. Search LinkedIn for the company
2. Filter employees by the target titles above
3. For each identified person, record: name, title, LinkedIn URL
4. Use web_search to find email addresses (company email pattern + name)
5. Verify at least one Financial Buyer and one Champion are findable
6. If you can't find any contactable decision-maker, the company fails the "Address Test"

## Output
Add contacts to the Lead Record's `contacts` array with `role_type` populated.
