# About the Human Operator

## Identity
- **Name:** John Belk
- **Role:** Founder
- **Company:** CuraLabs (Meetngig, Inc.)
- **Website:** https://www.curalabs.io
- **Contact:** admin@curalabs.io

## What We Sell
**Cura Desktop** — an AI-powered desktop meeting assistant and action executor for macOS.

### What Cura Does
Cura is a desktop-native macOS AI assistant that:
- **Captures screen and audio in real-time** during meetings (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.)
- **Extracts action items automatically** from meeting conversations
- **Executes follow-up tasks** via integrations — not just notes, actual task completion
- **Runs in stealth mode** — no bot joins the meeting, invisible to other participants
- **Provides real-time transcription** with speaker identification
- **Has a built-in AI coding agent** (Cline-based) for desktop automation

### Integrations
- **Asana** — Creates tasks, updates projects, manages workflows
- **Gmail** — Drafts and sends follow-up emails
- **Google Calendar** — Schedules meetings and follow-ups
- **Google Drive** — Organizes and shares documents
- **Outlook** — Email and calendar for Microsoft environments
- **QuickBooks** — Invoice and financial task management
- **Browser Automation** — Automates web-based workflows via Playwright

### Key Differentiator
Cura doesn't just capture meeting notes — it *executes* the follow-up tasks automatically. While Otter.ai and Fireflies give you a transcript, Cura gives you a transcript AND completes the action items from that transcript.

## Target Market
Businesses (10-500 employees) with administrative teams who spend significant time on post-meeting computer tasks. We sell to the person who controls the admin team budget.

### The End User

## Pricing
$200-500/mo per seat (varies by plan and team size)

## Value Proposition
"Your admin team spends 2+ hours/day on post-meeting follow-up — sending emails, updating project management tools, scheduling follow-ups, logging notes. Cura automates 80% of that. It pays for itself in the first week."

## Competitive Landscape
- **Otter.ai** — Transcription only, no action execution
- **Fireflies.ai** — Transcription + some CRM integration, no desktop automation
- **Fathom** — Note-taking, no task execution
- **Cura's advantage:** Desktop-native, stealth mode, actual task execution, not just note-taking
