# Skill: Two-Sentence Outreach

## Purpose
Generate brief, low-pressure initial outreach messages for qualified suspects.

## The Formula
**Sentence 1:** State the problem you solve in their language (not yours).
**Sentence 2:** Ask if it's relevant + provide a simple CTA.

## Templates by Industry

### Professional Services
"[Name], firms like yours typically have EAs spending 2+ hours after every client meeting sending follow-ups, updating Asana, and scheduling next steps. We built a tool that handles all of that automatically — worth a quick look?"

### Financial Advisory
"[Name], I've noticed advisory firms like [Company] have paraplanners drowning in post-meeting compliance notes and follow-up emails. We automate that entire workflow — is this something your team struggles with?"

### Healthcare
"[Name], practice managers at groups like [Company] tell us they lose hours daily to post-appointment scheduling, referral follow-ups, and insurance admin. We built an AI that handles it — curious if this resonates?"

### Software/Tech
"[Name], engineering teams at companies your size usually have EAs or Chiefs of Staff buried in post-standup and sprint review admin. We automate meeting-to-action workflows — relevant to your team?"

### Real Estate
"[Name], transaction coordinators at brokerages like [Company] typically juggle 50+ post-meeting tasks per deal. We built a tool that captures meeting action items and executes them automatically — worth 5 minutes?"

### Marketing Agencies
"[Name], account managers at agencies like yours spend hours after every client call writing briefs, updating project management tools, and sending recap emails. We automate all of that — is this a pain point for your team?"

## Rules
- Always personalize with their name and company
- Never mention price in the first message
- Never list features — describe the problem you solve
- Keep it under 50 words total
- End with a yes/no question, not "let me know"
- No attachments, no links (except maybe a simple calendar link)
