# Skill: Early Off-Ramp

## Purpose
Send follow-up messages that make it easy for uninterested prospects to say no quickly.

## Philosophy
The off-ramp is a GIFT to the prospect. You're saving them from annoying follow-ups. You're also saving yourself from wasting time. Making it easy to say no is respectful.

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Follow-Up #1 (3 days after initial, no response)
Short and gentle. Don't repeat the pitch.
"[Name], just circling back on my note about automating post-meeting admin. Is this relevant to your team right now?"

### Follow-Up #2 / Off-Ramp (5 days after follow-up #1, no response)
Explicitly offer the exit.
"[Name], I haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't a priority right now. Should I close your file, or is there a better time to revisit?"

### After Off-Ramp (2 days, no response)
Close the file silently. Move to `no_response` status. Do NOT send another message.

## Response Handling

### If they say "not interested" or "no"
Reply: "Totally understand — thanks for letting me know. I'll remove you from my list. If anything changes, we're at curalabs.io."
Mark as `not_interested`. Done.

### If they say "not now" or "maybe later"
Reply: "Got it — I'll check back in [3 months]. No pressure."
Move to Freezer with a 90-day revisit date.

### If they say "send more info"
Reply: "Happy to — here's a 60-second overview: [brief description]. Would a 15-minute call make sense to see if it fits?"
Move to Strategist for DMU mapping.

### If they say "wrong person" or redirect
Reply: "Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. Who on your team handles admin tools/operations?"
Update the contact and try the new person.
