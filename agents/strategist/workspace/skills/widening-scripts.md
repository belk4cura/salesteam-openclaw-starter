# Skill: Widening Scripts

## Purpose
Draft emails/messages the human founder can send to request access to additional stakeholders. The goal is to multi-thread the deal.

## Why Widening Matters
**Kent Summers' Rule: Single-threaded deals die.**
If only one person at the company is talking to you, the deal is fragile. That person could go on vacation, change roles, or lose interest. Multi-threaded deals survive because multiple people are invested.

## Script Templates

### Widening to Technical Buyer
**When to use:** Champion or Financial Buyer is engaged, but IT hasn't been involved yet.
**Script:**
"Thanks for the great conversation, [Champion Name]. Before we go further, I want to make sure Cura fits smoothly with your existing setup. Would it make sense to loop in whoever handles your IT/systems for a quick 10-minute compatibility check? We want to make sure there are no surprises."

### Widening to Financial Buyer
**When to use:** Champion is excited but doesn't control budget.
**Script:**
"[Champion Name], it sounds like Cura could save your team significant time. Before we invest more of your time in a demo, would it help to bring in [Financial Buyer Name/Title] so we can address budget questions early? That way we're all on the same page."

### Widening to Operational Buyer
**When to use:** Financial and Technical are on board, but end users haven't been consulted.
**Script:**
"[Financial Buyer Name], I want to make sure the people who'd actually use Cura daily are comfortable with it. Could we include one or two of your EAs/admin staff in a quick walkthrough? Their feedback will help us tailor the setup."

### Widening to Additional Departments
**When to use:** Initial department is excited, looking for expansion opportunity.
**Script:**
"[Champion Name], I noticed [Company] also has a [marketing/legal/finance] team with similar meeting-heavy workflows. Would it make sense to include their team lead in our next conversation? We often see companies roll out across departments once the first team sees results."

## Rules for Widening
- Always make it EASY for the contact to say yes (suggest specific names/roles)
- Always frame it as HELPFUL to them (not just for your deal)
- Always offer to keep it brief (10-15 minutes, not another full meeting)
- Never go around someone — always ask permission to involve others
- Time it right — don't widen too early (before interest is confirmed) or too late (after they've decided alone)
